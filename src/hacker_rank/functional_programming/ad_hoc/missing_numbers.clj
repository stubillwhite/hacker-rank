;; Sometimes you need to compare lists of number, but sorting each one normally will take too much time. Instead you can
;; use alternative methods to find the differences between each list.
;; 
;; Challenge 
;; Numeros The Artist was arranging two identical lists A and B into specific orders. The arrangements of the two arrays
;; were random, Numeros was very proud of his arrangements. Unfortunately, some numbers got left out of List A. Can you
;; find the missing numbers from A without messing up his order?
;; 
;; Details 
;; There are many duplicates in the lists, but you need to find the extra numbers, i.e. B - A. Print the numbers in
;; numerical order. Print each missing number once, even if it is missing multiple times. The numbers are all within a
;; range of 100 from each other.
;; 
;; Input Format 
;; There will be four lines of input:
;; 
;; n - the size of the first list 
;; This is followed by n numbers that makes up the first list. 
;; m - the size of the second list 
;; This is followed by m numbers that makes up the second list.
;; 
;; Output Format 
;; Output all the numbers (in ascending order) that are in B but not in A.
;; 
;; Constraints 
;; 1<= n,m <= 200000 
;; -10000 <= x <= 10000 , x âˆˆ B 
;; Xmax - Xmin < 101
